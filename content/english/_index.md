I am an assistant professor in corpus-based sociolinguistics in the [English Language & Linguistics Department](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/edacs/departments/englishlanguage/index.aspx) at the University of Birmingham. My research aims to better understand the nature of grammatical variation in the context of natural language use, both within and across language varieties. Prior to coming to Birmingham, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the [Quantitative Lexicology and Variational Linguistics](http://wwwling.arts.kuleuven.be/qlvl/) research unit at the University of Leuven (KU Leuven), Belgium. 

## Research interests

- corpus-based variationist linguistics
- end-weight effects in word order variation
- grammatical patterns across World Englishes
- argument realization and transitivity alternations
- stylistic variation across registers and genres

## Education

- PhD in Linguistics, 2013. Stanford University [[Thesis]](/pdfs/Grafmiller_thesis.pdf)
- BA in Linguistics, 2006. The Ohio State University

This file is left intentionally empty by default to be backwards compatible with the initial theme setup.

Although the theme has advanced a little bit and it now allows to specify the content on the main page (even if the list of posts/articles is not intended).
This can be:
- with the list of posts/articles (default: `mainSections = ["post"]) or
- without the list of posts/articles (by setting `mainSections = [""]`)

Markdown supported, ie:

```
